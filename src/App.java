/**
 * You are going to write code that is designed to store student ID numbers.
 * You will create an ArrayList for Integers, then accept user input to add values 
 * to that ArrayList. There will be additional modifications you can make:
 * 
 * B level:
 * Accept input from users, add values to an ArrayList
 * 
 * B+ level:
 * B level plus stop accepting input when the user enters -1. After this, the full
 * list of student numbers should be printed, one student ID per line.
 * 
 * A- level: 
 * Complete B and B+. Also do not allow duplicates. When the user enters a student ID 
 * that already exists, tell them they cannot add duplicates then continue accepting input 
 * as per B+ level.
 * 
 * A+ level:
 * Complete B and B+. Modify A- so that when a duplicate value is entered, the user is asked 
 * whether they want to delete the existing value. If they enter "yes", the value is removed
 * from the ArrayList. Ignore any other input and do not add the value to the ArrayList.
 * 
 * An A will be awarded for an attempt at A+ that is close but not complete.
